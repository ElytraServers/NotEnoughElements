# Not Enough Elements

A Not Enough Items addon Mod, providing advanced searching on Elements of GregTech items.

You can activate it by starting with `el:` or `element:`, and connects with the elements in short, like `el:Og`(matching
items that contains Oganesson) or `element:Al !O`(matching items that contains Aluminium, and not contains Oxygen).

## Inspiration

I just want to find the ores with Chromium, and as I search for `Cr`, all the **Cr**ushed Ores pops up, and got me mad!
