# Elytra Mining

This mod adds 2 type of hammers that can break a flat/cubic area, which should be same to the Thermal Foundation
one in 1.12+ by CoFH Team.

And a torch that will be falling when the block that the torch attached is destroyed, like sand. This is quite helpful
when mining a huge area, and you don't want to replace all the torches the dropped.

## Credits

This project uses template [ExampleMod1.7.10](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ExampleMod1.7.10) by GTNewHorizons,
and is inspired by Thermal Foundation, which is used in Omnifactory that I loved to play.

Btw, this mod is developed for my GTNH sub server of "Elytra Servers". So here is why there is an "Elytra" in mod
name. (This is asked by the administrator of Modrinth, lol)
